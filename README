gen_ladder - tool to generate protocol ladder diagrams
(C) 2010-2011 by Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org>

This tool can be used to generate typical ladder diagrams as they are often
used in the description of networking protocols.

The input file is a ".lad" file, from which gen_ladder.pl generates a PNG

As an example, I have included a "test.lad" file, which you can process by
calling
	make test.png
